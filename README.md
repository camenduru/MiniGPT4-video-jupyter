- Question: "What's this video talking about?"
- Answer: "This video features a woman in her mid-50s talking to the camera while focusing on Sadiq Khan, who is also shown briefly. The main topic of conversation appears to be about Britain's exit from Europe and what it means for British people living there as well as those elsewhere around the world interested in such matters related with trade deals like Theresa May's deal or no deal Brexit discussions surrounding Prime Minister Boris Johnson's recent statements regarding leaving the EU by October 31st without an agreement if Parliament does not approve any other agreements beforehand that are currently being debated within UK parliamentary politics specifically referencing former PM Teressa may’s previous negotiations during which she failed three times."
